# Language

Library that updates certain (menustrips) controls in response to which (language) the user selects.

You may need to import other modules available in other repositories in my account - these imports are in VB.Net (Web Module, NModule, General Module, Feedback etc).

Uses:
.NET Framework 4.6

May use:
NewtonSoft.Json 10.0.0

Thanks!
